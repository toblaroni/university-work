# Compiler Design and Construction
In this module we learnt how compilers turn code into executable. We were tasked to build the lexer, the parser and the code generation modules for a simple programming language based off of the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) Jack language. All modules were built in C. The compiler turns Jack code into virtual machine code.

Unfortunately I was unable to completely finish the code generation module. However, outside of Uni [I completed the Nand2Tetris course](https://github.com/toblaroni/NAND2TETRIS) and re-implemented this simple compiler in Rust.

I loved this module. The professor was fantastic and prior to the module, compilers always seemed like a black box to me. While the compiler we made is for a very simple programming language, the basic ideas are the same.
