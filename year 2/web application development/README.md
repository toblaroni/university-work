# Web Application Development
In this module I learnt how to make web applications. Before this I had only ever made static websites (front-end only) so it was exciting finally building a backend and a database.

For the coursework we had to build a web application of our choice. I built an app where users can upload their meal-deals and other users can upvote them. The app was built using Flask, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript and Bootstrap.
