### OS - Coursework

For this coursework I to implement `malloc()` and `free()` for the [xv6 operating system](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2025/xv6.html).

memory is allocated on the heap using a linked list with first fit allocation. It also implements coalescence of contiguous blocks using recursion :-)
