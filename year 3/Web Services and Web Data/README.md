# Web Services and Web Data
There were two parts to this module, the first was about REST APIs and the second was about search engines.

### Coursework 1
For the first coursework we had to implement a REST API and a client using Python and the Flask framework. 

### Coursework 2
The second coursework was to build a search tool for a simple website. The tool consisted of a web scraper which builds an inverted index of words and pages and a search tool to allow the user to search for words or phrases. This was also written in Python.
