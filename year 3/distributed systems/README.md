# Distributed Systems
In this module I learnt what distributed systems are, how they are designed and implemented and the benefits of such systems. 

Coursework 2 of this module involved writing our own severless app using Azure functions. My app was written in Python and it analysed audio files that were sent to the app's endpoint.
