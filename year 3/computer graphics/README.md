# Computer Graphics
This module taught us the basic computer graphics pipeline and introduced me to OpenGL and shaders. While this module was super hard, I loved the visual feedback you get when your implementation starts to work.

### Coursework 1
For the first coursework we had to implement and test simple 2D graphic functions like drawing lines, triangles and blitting.

### [Coursework 2](https://github.com/toblaroni/COMP3811-CWK2)
For our second coursework we had to implement a 3D graphic scene. This was completed in pairs. I was responsible for implementing the first-person camera and controls, instancing, basic lighting and Blinn-Phong lighting, split-screen feature and a particle system.
